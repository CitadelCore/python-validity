# Mapping for users
# Add mappings from a user to a SID to use the same fingerprints as enrolled by
# Windows. By default, mappings will be generated from the numerical UID if not
# found here. This is fine if you are not dual booting and want to share
# mappings with Windows.

    # Example:
    #"username": "S-1-5-21-1234567890-1234567890-1234567890-1234"
